<p style="color:red;"><b>•Over utilizing any flavor of the month meme, like "imposter" or "sus" is a bit too OOC IC. Obviously if you have a reason to use them, like calling someone suspicious with sus its fine. However blurting them out at random is a bit much and we're cracking down on it. </a></b>
